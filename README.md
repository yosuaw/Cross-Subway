# Cross-Subway

## Overview
Cross Subway is an arcade game that was developed during the student challenge course in algorithms and programming (2019). This game was developed using the C# programming language. The name "Cross Subway" comes from how to play this game itself where players have to try to cross the subway tracks to get points. This game is actually a story game designed in such a way as to be an arcade game.

## Story
In this game the player plays as a young teenager named Adam. Adam with his father and mother went by train to a city in the United States called Garnet. But on their way to Garnet, the train they were riding on suddenly got damaged and had a big accident. When Adam woke up, he couldn't find his father and mother so he could only scream for help while terrified. No one answered Adam, but there was a creepy voice that seemed to be answering Adam. And it turns out that the sound comes from a very scary ghost. This is where the excitement of this game begins.

## Gameplay
As Adam, player must try to escape from the ghosts by crossing the existing train tracks. Players have to be careful because there are many old ghost trains that are passing on these rails. The player must cross the existing rails to the stairs in the upper left corner or the stairs in the upper right corner. If the player is caught by a ghost chasing him, then the player's health point will be reduced by 1/5 of the total health point and will get an immune effect for 2 seconds and the ghost chasing him will stop briefly. If the player is hit by a train, then the player's health point will be reduced by 1/2 of the total health point and will get an immune effect for 2 seconds, the same as when caught by a ghost. This game uses a score system where players can get points when they reach the stairs in the upper left corner or the stairs in the upper right corner. Every time the player reaches the ladder, the player will get a score, and the player position wil be reset in the lower left corner or in the lower right corner and the ghost chasing him will retreat as far as the distance between the player and the ghost before reaching the stairs. The player's highest score while playing this game will be displayed at the top center of the screen.
